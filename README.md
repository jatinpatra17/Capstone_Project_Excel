# Sales_Project_Excel

I've Developed a dynamic Sales Analysis Dashboard using Excel to track and analyze sales performance. The dashboard features interactive visualizations, custom calculations, and real-time data updates.

This interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, profits, and customer trends. It includes visualizations for:

- Year-over-year (YoY) growth comparisons
- Sales and profit trends over time
- Category-wise sales and profit breakdowns
- Top-selling subcategories
- Sales by state
- Interactive filters for segmentation and region-wise analysis
- This dashboard empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and identify areas for improvement.
